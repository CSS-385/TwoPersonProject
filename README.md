# CSS385 Game

This is a game a simpler copy of the [Bridge Runner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmg8u4BVlLI&list=PLKp0rMepXakSUuEGP5koRUkSi206I8kQF&index=2) game from 2016.

It can be played [here](https://css-385.github.io/TwoPersonProject/).

It's made by James Brusewitz and Kyler Li.

## Controls

The controls are simple:
 - **AD** to move around
 - **Space** to jump

## Mechanics

The game is a simple 2D platformer with wallhanging, wall jumping, and extended
jumps by holding the jump button. On top of that, is a randomized and endless
level that is slowly destroyed by a UFO. The UFO slowly ramps up in speed as the
player runs away and tries to survive as long as possible. There is also a
parallax background and follow camera.

## Challenges

Thinking about the different states in the platforming was quite difficult, and
figuring out a method to randomly generate levels was difficult too. However,
the rest of the features were relatively simple to create. Overall, Kyler spent
about 12 hours creating the bulk of the mechanics and features. James spent
4 hours creating some mechanics and the art.
